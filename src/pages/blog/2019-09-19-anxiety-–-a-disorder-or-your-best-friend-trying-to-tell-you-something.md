 It was a Wednesday in May and I was 24 years old. That morning I couldn’t catch my breath, I couldn’t move my body and my sight was compromised, so I found myself in a hospital, hooked up to machines.

It was a week before I was about to move across the globe, to Australia, without a plan.

After hours of testing, the doctor confirmed that it was not a heart attack, but a massive panic attack. He told me not to worry. I could go ahead and travel, but if it happened again, I should see a doctor and get tested for anxiety disorder.

A few weeks later I was sitting on a beach, on a little Island in Indonesia. It was nighttime. As I was sitting in silence looking at the sky, my lips started to tremble, my eyes started to twitch, and a tear pushed itself through my eyelid.

More tears followed and now I was crying for the first time, since my grandfather’s funeral, more than a year earlier. I realized, that my body had been inviting me to have conversations, I was trying to ignore. But now I was stuck on an island with no substances, job, friends or things to run away to – it was time to listen.

The grief of my grandfather’s death was talking to me and when I ignored it, it started banging and screaming; “I don’t want to live inside of you. You must acknowledge me and let me go. You are meant to recover from this, without me destroying you.”

The meaninglessness of my job was speaking to me and when I ignored it, it pushed and shouted; “You have to find something that gives you purpose. You have to go somewhere where you can express your voice and make a difference.”

My intention with moving to Australia was stirring the deepest parts of me; “You won’t find peace when you’re running away. Peace is when you are moving towards something.”

That day I agreed to be in a relationship with my body. It hasn’t been easy. It has meant to endure and dissolve extreme pain. It has meant fighting, communicating and finding language, for things that didn’t have language yet. It has meant doing the necessary, instead of the seemingly easy. But it has been worth it, because I depend on my body completely and I know that it always has my best interest at heart.

And our relationship has never been better.
