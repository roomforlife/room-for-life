 The truth of my situation was, that I was more than in a bad place. I was drowning in a deep ocean of guilt and incompetence and I felt like, I didn’t have any strength left to reach the surface for air.

I couldn’t play tennis anymore. With a broken back I couldn’t step out on the red clay to swing the racket and transform hurt, disempowerment and frustration into a beautiful dance with my opponent, for the audience to watch. For years the court had been my escape from pain. It had been a place where I could be somebody, where I could do something, where I could be away from home.

Tennis was what I did and when I couldn’t do it anymore, I ate some food. Went into the bathroom and put two fingers into my throat to induce vomiting.

Simultaneously my mother left her husband and I felt, at that time, that their divorce was my fault. When my mother had taken this brave decision, life had become overwhelming and someone close to her told me one day - just this one sentence, while passing me by: “your mom is in a bad place. If you see her upset or angry, run to the balcony door and don’t let her get out there”.

I didn’t know what to do, so I ate some food. Went into the bathroom and put two fingers into my throat to induce vomiting.

I couldn’t be in school, because I was worried about my mom. I couldn’t be with her, because I didn’t know what to do with the responsibility, I felt towards taking care of her. So, I ate some food. Went into the bathroom and put two fingers into my throat to induce vomiting.

With time the inner pain got so intense, that I would be caught, if I had to go to the bathroom every time I needed to vomit. So, I ate some food, stayed in my room and put two fingers into my throat to induce vomiting into a plastic bag, I hid in my drawer.

Soon there were many bags hidden in my room and I was on my way to see a psychologist.

This woman gave me something. She made clear the deepest truth of my existence - that I am able and whole. She said, “you are vomiting because you feel you need to, right now. You are getting rid of pain. When you don’t feel the need, you won’t do it anymore. You are going through a tremendous life crisis and you will get through it.”

What I heard was, that I was competent. I was a competent human being, dealing with my life the best way I could. This vomiting was not working for me anymore and I could find another solution, that was better for me. And with time I did.

At the end of the day, that is all I want to give forward – the assurance that you are able and whole. Because the words we give each other can determine how we move forward in our lives.

No matter how broken you may feel, there is nothing wrong with you.

No matter how dysfunctional you may feel, there is nothing to be fixed within you.

Even though your behavior is causing you pain and is bad for you, it is meaningful. Once you understand what it is a reaction to, you will be able to do something else.

You are always more than the pain and the crises you are going through.

Don’t let anyone tell you different.
