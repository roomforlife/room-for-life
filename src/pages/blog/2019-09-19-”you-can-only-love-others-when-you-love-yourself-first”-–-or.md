  I don’t know how old this saying is, but it has made a comeback, with the
  empowerment wave we are experiencing. I can’t count the times I have been
  nodding to this sentence, but the nodding always has a silent ‘but’ to it.

  I am all for empowerment – I embody it! But what are we actually saying with
  this sentence? What does it even mean? – are we now individualizing love as
  well?

I remember in my darkest days, when I fundamentally felt unlovable and I went out with my girlfriends; we were present, we talked, we danced, we jumped, we laughed, we were so connected that we completely gave and received love - we created love.

I went to my grandparent’s house where we cooked, we laughed, we hugged, we sang, we created a safe space where we gave and received love – we created love.

I went into my mom’s bed and we held each other, we whispered, we listened, we cried, we reassured each other, we created a dreamworld where we gave and received love – we created love.

In love there was never me or them first, but the love we created could spill into all those places where love was not to be found.

So maybe a better saying would be;

You can only love yourself in places where love can thrive - in places where love is possible and that can absolutely, also be a place, where you are alone loving yourself for the miracle that you are.
